Rally-AppTemplate-Grunt
=======================
## Setting Up To Develop ##

We're moving from rake over to grunt. The advantage of a building system is that we can divide the product into 
separate files (JS, CSS) that are combined together into a single HTML file that gets put into the panel in Rally.
(Apps live inside iframes, so they are basically html files with JS.)  Also, we can create a debug version that 
doesn't have to be copied in on every change while developing.

To develop, you'll need to set up an environment, following these steps (in detail below):
1. Install git and download the source
2. Install node.js. Node.js provides a runtime environment and a bunch of other packaging tools useful for the building and testing process.
3. Install grunt. Think of grunt as a JavaScript makefile.


1. Install git.
We use github as our version control system. If you're not a Rally developer, you'll want to fork the repository and then make a clone locally. Follow the instructions on github.

2. Install node.js.
This really is as simple as going to http://nodejs.org/ and pushing the Install button. Afterward, type this command to see that it installed:
`npm --version`

3. Install grunt.
From the command line, use the node package manager to install grunt. On linux/mac, you might have to use sudo as shown below. On Windows, you will not use the sudo part of the command.
`sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
sudo npm install -g grunt-init`

4. Change directories to the root of this project and locally install grunt. I'm not sure what this does.
`npm install grunt`

5. Locally install additional dependencies: grunt-templater, and underscore:
`npm install grunt-templater
 npm install underscore`


## Developing ##

### Grunt ###
The gruntfile has two tasks. To run a task, type `grunt <task name>`. For example:
`grunt debug`

The default task will run if you don't provide a task name.

*default* Creates a version of the html file (in the deploy directory) that must be cut and pasted into the App panel in Rally.
*debug* Creates a version of the html file (at project root) that can be loaded into a browser and refreshed to test whenever you change the JS files. (You still have to log into Rally in another browser tab.)

### config.json ###
This file provides a few configuration settings for the app you are creating. Change the server and sdk settings when developing against a different sdk or testing on another server. The javascript and css settings are no longer required -- they're historical -- because the gruntfile just pulls the list of JS files from the src directory.
